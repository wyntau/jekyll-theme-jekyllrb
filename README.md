## Installation

You can install the latest code via [`jekyll-remote-theme`](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme):

1. Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

    ```ruby
    gem "jekyll-remote-theme"
    ```

2. Add these lines to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

    ```ruby
    plugins:
      - jekyll-remote-theme

    remote_theme: wyntau/jekyll-theme-jekyllrb
    ```

3. Because the latest gem version jekyll do not support read files in theme's `_data` directory, so use the latest version jekyll in github in your `Gemfile`

    ```
